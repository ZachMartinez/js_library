# Simple JavaScript Library App

This is a simple app for keeping track of your books. This app was built for [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) [JavaScript Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) project.

You can watch a video [here](#) where I show the process of building this project.
